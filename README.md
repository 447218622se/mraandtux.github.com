>Hong Kong's Leader Carrie Lamb said the recent protess was having "very fine people on both sides". Wrong! I started using the Pharse TWO YEARS AGO, and I will trademark that phrase by my kids!

>Hong Kong's Leader Carrie Lamb said she "need and bring back Law and Order". She's using my quotes to boost her ratings after the folks in Baejean dumped her like Pattinson dumped Stewart - not approved, will sue!

>Is Kantone invaded by Mexicans? Or there was NO COLLUSION on the city's language? If anyone works here in America and don't speak the language, that person should be FIRED! (Mr President, you spelled my town's name wrong, [here's some "fake news"](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/asia/endangered-languages-welsh-hawaiian-cantonese-intl/index.html) - #SupportCantoContent)

>One of[@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1063629719592026112) 's Favorite Artist, [@cfm_miku_en](https://twitter.com/cfm_miku_en) is coming to Kantone This November, after the Untalented Hologram revisits Hong Kong despite HUGE protess over the weeks. Sad! Will never buy any products endorsed by Her and Her Gang(#LuoTianyi beware)! (Mr President, you did it again - you're spelling is worse than the previous tweet, but [you managed to get your source right](http://whly.gd.gov.cn/audit/content/post_2532976.html))

 We'll keep our eyes on M$.
>Marge tells Homer Bill Gates is here to see him. Homer panicks, and tells
>Marge to get out of here so it doesn't look like a two-bit operation.

Bill Gates: Mr. Simpson?

Homer: You don't look so rich...

Bill Gates: Don't let the haircut fool you, I am exceedingly wealthy.

Homer: (quietly) Get a load of the bowl-job, Marge!

Bill Gates: Your Internet ad was brought to my attention, but I can't figure out what, if
anything, Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net does, **so rather than risk competing with
you, I've decided simply to buy you out.**

>Homer and Marge quietly discuss this proposal.

Homer: I reluctantly accept your proposal!

Bill Gates: Well everyone always does. Buy 'em out, boys!


>(Gates' lackeys trash the room.)

Homer: Hey, what the hell's going on!

Bill Gates: Oh, I didn't get rich by writing a lot of checks! (insane laughter)

 We'll keep our eyes on M$.
>Marge tells Homer Bill Gates is here to see him. Homer panicks, and tells
>Marge to get out of here so it doesn't look like a two-bit operation.

Bill Gates: Mr. Simpson?

Homer: You don't look so rich...

Bill Gates: Don't let the haircut fool you, I am exceedingly wealthy.

Homer: (quietly) Get a load of the bowl-job, Marge!

Bill Gates: Your Internet ad was brought to my attention, but I can't figure out what, if
anything, Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net does, **so rather than risk competing with
you, I've decided simply to buy you out.**

>Homer and Marge quietly discuss this proposal.

Homer: I reluctantly accept your proposal!

Bill Gates: Well everyone always does. Buy 'em out, boys!


>(Gates' lackeys trash the room.)

Homer: Hey, what the hell's going on!

Bill Gates: Oh, I didn't get rich by writing a lot of checks! (insane laughter)

<h1>FlashBack - 2012: When the Infamous "Welsh Not" Policy Returns... in China as "Cantonese Not"</h1>
<u>(PS - references in this post are in Chinese; this is a summary in English)</u><br>
When "Cantonese Not" affected in a elementary school in Southern China's Guangdong province, the Internet and language watchdogs responded with thunders full of hate messages to the headmaster.<br>
Quote Zheng Hui, the headmaster of Xiancun Elementary School in Guangzhou (Guangdong's provincial capital, hundred miles from Hong Kong), said "all Cantonese speaker are scums" - which later denied during an interview with local media. During the interview, she also claims that its "Cantonese Not" policy are not accurate - "Dialect Not" is, due to many immigrant students from other parts of China living in the neighbourhood went to this school, and these students are speaking Mandarin with a regional accent ("dialects" we called in China),  so the school decides to set up a "language code" that speaking languages like Cantonese, Hakka, Teochew or speaking Mandarin with a regional accent will impact the student's performance on "civility", if one of the faculty members speaks one of the languages or dialects, the teacher will be reported to the school board and warned. "This policy has been set up for many years", according to Mrs Zheng.<br>
Internet has bombarded its headmater with messages like "#LanguageAssimilator", "She's a #MadarinExtremist" and "Fire her". A majority of schools in the province are teaching in Mandarin, with exepction in some schools using Cantonese, Hakka, Teochew to teaching local culture lessons.<br>
